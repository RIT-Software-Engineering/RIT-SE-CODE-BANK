# Overview
The SCOOP Portal project is a collaborative platform designed specifically for the SE department's SCOOP program. This portal will streamline the management of projects, facilitate communication, and enhance collaboration among students (SCOOPloyees), coaches (SCOOPervisors), and coordinators (SCOOPdinators). Additionally, the portal will serve as a public archive where general users (Viewers) can browse completed SCOOP projects.

# Objective

Provides role-specific tools and interfaces tailored to SCOOPloyees, SCOOPervisors, SCOOPdinators, and public Users.
Streamlines project management through integrated task and milestone tracking.
Facilitates communication and feedback between team members, coaches, and administrators.
Showcases completed SCOOP projects in a public-facing archive.
