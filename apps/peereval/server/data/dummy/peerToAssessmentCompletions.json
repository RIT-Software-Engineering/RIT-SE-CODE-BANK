It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.",

But stay your weeping—we have no time to lose; go, rather, and tell the servants to make ready a meal of the best that there is. I have brought spoil from many places, and there is enough to feast us all.’",
